Hi Louis,

It's been a long time.  If you remember I used your Fast Intrinsic Mode Decomposition to pull noise out of a video of blood flow in the retina.

But I have never gotten your second paper's method working well.  I found the github

https://github.com/louisyulu/eef-utilities

And I downloaded the folder, and brought it up with Visual Code so that I can see how you have put things together.

Well again, for the life of me when I put what I think is the important stuff in the language I use (IDL).  It still does not work. I never get to the place where I only have a few control points.  Have you or anyone ever rewritten it some other language? I don't know dart  and I don't want to take the time to figure out how to run it in debugger.
